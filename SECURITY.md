# Security Policy

In fact, I'm stupid in these matters


## Supported Versions
If I support security updates, then only for these versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.6.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.4.0 | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability
I donâ€™t know if serious vulnerabilities are possible in such a small project as this, but if you find something serious, then you can report it to this [email address](mailto:owner@kindit.xyz).  

If your letter reaches me, I will respond from this or another email address within 7 days.
